            <p class="leading-relaxed"><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). 

              Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some argue that much of the technology used in the real world today actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or “general artificial intelligence” (GAI).
              
              Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use the term AI today, they’re referring to a suite of machine learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously only humans can do like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data. </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2">What is artificial general intelligence (AGI)? </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed"><b>Artificial general intelligence (AGI)</b> refers to a theoretical state in which computer systems will be able to achieve or exceed human intelligence. In other words, AGI is “true” artificial intelligence as depicted in countless science fiction novels, television shows, movies, and comics. 

              As for the precise meaning of “AI” itself, researchers don’t quite agree on how we would recognize “true” artificial general intelligence when it appears. However, the most famous approach to identifying whether a machine is intelligent or not is known as the Turing Test or Imitation Game, an experiment that was first outlined by influential mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst Alan Turing in a 1950 paper on computer intelligence. There, Turing described a three-player game in which a human “interrogator” is asked to communicate via text with another human and a machine and judge who composed each response. If the interrogator cannot reliably identify the human, then Turing says the machine can be said to be intelligent [1]. 
              
              To complicate matters, researchers and philosophers also can’t quite agree whether we’re beginning to achieve AGI, if it’s still far off, or just totally impossible. For example, while a recent paper from Microsoft Research and OpenAI argues that Chat GPT-4 is an early form of AGI, many other researchers are skeptical of these claims and argue that they were just made for publicity [2, 3].
              
              Regardless of how far we are from achieving AGI, you can assume that when someone uses the term artificial general intelligence, they’re referring to the kind of sentient computer programs and machines that are commonly found in popular science fiction. </p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed">AI has a range of applications with the potential to transform how we work and our daily lives. While many of these transformations are exciting, like self-driving cars, virtual assistants, or wearable devices in the healthcare industry, they also pose many challenges.
              Companies are using AI technology to streamline their daily processes, analyze upcoming trends, forecast growth, and predict outcomes. For instance, anytime a customer places an item into their shopping cart on the websites of some major retailers, they are immediately given an additional suggested item to purchase based on an advanced algorithm. This algorithm has been programmed to compare thousands of other customers who have purchased similar items and make an informed suggestion. Additionally, social media platforms use a form of applied AI, known as machine learning, to display specific content to their users, and the more an individual uses the platform, the more the AI learns about them. By utilizing extensive neural networking, machine learning becomes superior in smart-decision making.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Automation is a major benefit of artificial intelligence in the business world. Businesses use automation to stay connected with new and returning customers through auto-reply emails, appointment reminders, and feedback surveys. If you’ve ever purchased a coffee and received an instantaneous text receipt, that’s just one example of how AI is improving business practices. Furthermore, many online retailers rely on automation through drop shipment suppliers to streamline their processes, reduce the need for large storage facilities, and increase their efficacy. Through limiting human input by way of automation, businesses can make better use of their employees’ skills and time.</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">Modern medicine has also embraced AI in helping doctors and nurses diagnose and treat patients without requiring  an expensive or time-consuming hospital visit. For example, doctors can track a diabetic patient’s glucose levels with the assistance of a glucose monitoring app, and that same patient can get real-time data about their health from the comfort of their home. Patient records and medical history can be shared within seconds from hospital to hospital through online portals, and crucial information can be gathered for community health outcomes, as seen with recent at-home tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Essentially, medical professionals can focus more on the needs of the patient and community while AI does the busy work.</p>

Information that would have taken months to collect now can be done in minutes, if not seconds. For example, a language learning app, like Duolingo or Babbel, might discover that half of their users plateau in fluency after three months of learning and incorporate more supportive lessons to fill that gap.  Or a meal delivery service might use an algorithm to learn that stay-at-home moms more regularly check their emails and meal plan in the mornings and pivot their email marketing to gain the best results. The wealth of knowledge that’s gained from artificial intelligence research and data analysis is indispensable.</p>

Machines built in this way don’t possess any knowledge of previous events but instead only “react” to what is before them in a given moment. As a result, they can only perform certain advanced tasks within a very narrow scope, such as playing chess, and are incapable of performing tasks outside of their limited context.</p>
